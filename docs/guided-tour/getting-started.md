# Getting Started

Welcome to the guided tour of Semaphore ðŸ‘‹

In this guide we help you get up and running with Semaphore and introduce you to its key features.

## What is Semaphore?

Semaphore is a cloud-based [continuous integration and delivery][cicd] (CI/CD) service for building, testing, and deploying software. With Semaphore, there is no software to install or infrastructure to maintain.

Semaphore is built for developer productivity, and guided is by two principles:

1. **Speed**: Developers must work in a fast feedback loop,
so CI/CD processes must be fast.
2. **Ease of use**: CI/CD tool needs to support developers in everything they
need to build, at any scale, without getting in the way.

Semaphore stores the [CI/CD pipeline][cicd-pipeline] configuration files in the Git repository, right next to your software. By connecting with your Git repository, Semaphore can execute the pipeline every time code changes.

In the background, Semaphore manages the hardware resources needed to run
CI/CD jobs just-in-time. Semaphore runs all your CI/CD processes in an isolated and secure environment.

## What sets Semaphore apart?

A combination of features make Semaphore a strong fit for teams wanting to get things done:

- **Pipelines as code**: traditionally associated with tools that require
costly self-hosting and detailed customization, Semaphore pipelines are easy to use and infinitely configurable.
- **It's the fastest there is**: Semaphore provides the best out of the box CI/CD
performance on the market, which means shorter development cycles and faster
innovation. Moving to Semaphore usually saves developers hours of precious time per week.
- **There's nothing to maintain**: with no resources to manage, scale, or pay
for separately, developers can focus on building products. Semaphore has a
track record of providing a reliable CI/CD service since 2012.
- **No vendor lock-in**: Semaphore is committed to supporting all major code
hosting and cloud providers, leaving you freedom to choose optimal solutions.

## Next steps

It's time to [add a Git repository][next]. You will be able to see Semaphore in action first before
customizing it for your use case.
